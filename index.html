                <h3>About</h3>
                <p>Ferrero Rocher is a chocolate and hazelnut confectionery, introduced in 1982 and produced by the Italian company 
                    Ferrero. Michele Ferrero is credited as the product's creator. Each Ferrero Rocher ball is covered in foil and placed into a paper liner. The confection is machine 
                    made and much of its production process is designed to be secretive.[1] It is sold worldwide and holds a strong cultural presence, in part because of its association with Christmas. 
                    The brand is known in the United Kingdom, and other countries such as Mexico, by the popular 1990s 'ambassadors' advertisement.[2]</p>

                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>Ferrero Rocher was introduced in 1979 in Italy and in other parts of Europe in 1982. Shortly after its release, 
                    production was halted due to a problem with label printing.[3] Michele Ferrero, the credited inventor, named the 
                    chocolate after a grotto in the Roman Catholic shrine of Lourdes, Rocher de Massabielle [fr].[4] Rocher comes from 
                    French and means rock or boulder.[5]

                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <p>Ingredients
                    The chocolate consists of a whole roasted hazelnut encased in a thin wafer shell filled with hazelnut chocolate and 
                    covered in milk chocolate and chopped hazelnuts.[6] Its ingredients are milk chocolate, sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa mass, 
                    skim milk powder, butteroil, lecithin as emulsifier (soy), vanillin (artificial flavor), hazelnuts, palm oil, wheat flour, 
                    whey (milk), low fat cocoa powder, sodium bicarbonate (leavening agent), and salt.[7]

                <h3>Production</h3>
                <p>The production process is secretive, with no smartphones or notebooks allowed inside the production facilities. As of 2015, 
                    few journalists have ever been invited to visit.[8] As of 2015, the production in the Alba factory totals 24 million 
                    Ferrero Rochers a day.[8] The sweet is produced by machinery. The process begins with flat sheets of wafer with hemispheres 
                    moving down an assembly line.[9] The hemispheres of the wafers are then filled with a chocolate hazelnut cream and part of 
                    a hazelnut. Next, two of these wafer sheets, one with a hazelnut and one with hazelnut chocolate cream, are clamped together. 
                    The excess wafer is cut away producing wafer balls. These balls are then coated with a layer of chocolate, a layer of chopped 
                    hazelnuts, and a final layer of milk chocolate[9] before the chocolate ball is wrapped in its prominent gold foil.[3]

                    28 countries in Europe including the UK, eight countries in Asia, five countries in Africa including South Africa, nine 
                    countries in the Americas, and two countries in Oceania.[11]
